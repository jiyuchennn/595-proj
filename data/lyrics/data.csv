1399,0x4Z0Rc7NOEmyK0sP0YMO5,track 1 outer space really hated this one at first but it has grown on me a little bit on further listens yela s flow is super intense and it s giving me some rage against the machine vibes kind of like a southern zach de la rocha the instrumental itself is pretty nice with a chaotic sound coming out of it the weird robotic voice change at the end was kind of cool kinda thought the opening skit was kind of useless but oh well 7 10 track 2 change absolutely love the beat on here and yela s flow is so smooth and matches the beat great he sings the hook great and the backing vocals by the woman sounds pretty awesome added into the backdrop 3rd verse was pretty nice too with him ragging on the industry a bit the robot voice this time around sort of takes me out of the song a bit though 7 5 10 track 3 american you a great pre release song that holds up well on the album he really does have a great singing voice and this song showcases that talent extremely great this is a great hybrid with some minor rapping thrown in over a lot of dope singing especially in the third verse yelawolf pulled this off without trying to sound poppy or radio friendly 8 10 track 4 whiskey in a bottle another amazing song that i really fucked with when it was released before the album still sounds great and is pretty awesome in the continuity of the album the hook is absolutely amazing even the lalalalala part which i actually enjoy the beat has a droning feel to it which i think is awesome and his flow matches up great too 9 10 track 5 ball and chain interlude honestly usually when i see the words interlude i m expecing a cringe worth skit but instead yela gave us a short but sweet dope little singing piece that is actually pretty damn good 8 10 track 6 till it s gone my favorite pre release song as well as what i think is yela s best rap song to date the instrumental is a perfect mix of country guitar and etherial rap in the background wolf also has such an intense flow as well as nice makes this a super dope song 9 5 10 track 7 devil in my veins the best pure singing song on the project easily yela s vocals are really haunting and kind of give you a depressing feeling when he goes on and on not gonna lie i cried the other day listening to this don t know why exactly but i just felt something well up and then the tears started coming out doesn t usually happen so props to yelawolf for getting that reaction out of me the instrumental is also a awesome 10 10 track 8 best friend after a string of great songs this joint which should have been amazing got completely ruined by eminem em literally used the worst flow possible for this song plus some really cringeworthy to top it off he single handedly derailed the song i wish yelawolf would have taken this song solo or got big krit on it because yela had some amazing singing on the hook and nice verses sigh what could have been 6 10 track 9 empty bottles another absolutely amazing song with a great instrumental and what has now became typically amazing singing from wolf he has a great slower rapping style on this song and the best way to describe this joint is that it has a slower vibe that still manages to feel really sinister really dope shit 10 10 track 10 heartbreak i liked the piano beat which idk why but it sounded like a more interesting version of same love the instrumental does grow on you a lot as goes on and yela s rapping while subdued still sounds very great on this song the hook is one of the best on the album imo and it makes this song that much better this is one of those joints that will grown on you more and more 9 10 track 11 tennessee love yes this song has been around forever but it fits perfectly on this project it still sounds good and actually sounds even better once you have gotten used to the half singing half rapping that is all over this project a great vibing out song that has only improved its quality on my ears 8 5 10 track 12 box chevy v this would sound great on any of his trunk muzik tapes but this sound really out of place on this album the instrumental is decent but like i said it sounds strange to show up on this album this also isn t his best song from the box chevy series it sounds better in the second half when there is more guitars to get the more country feeling to it not a bad song but i wish he would have put it on a different project 7 10 track 13 love story another song on here that i didn t think was all that great at first but completely grew on me this might lowkey be one of his best rapping performances on this album he just keeps getting more and more intense as it goes and it sounds really well with piano that drones along this song went from one of my least favorites to one of my favorites 9 10 track 14 johnny cash the instrumental is just absolutely amazing here the angel sounding women in the background and the lone guitar mixed together really makes this some top notch shit this is another slow burn type of song it really does have slow pacing and rapping to it but i really love how well it sounds album highlight for sure 9 5 10 track 15 have a great flight another song that has some really dope and haunting vocals from yelawolf at this point i think it is safe to say that yela is the best rapper that also sings currently in the whole genre of hip hop no joke this guy has a pretty golden voice and it is great how he both sings and raps on his songs and it sounds naturally good 9 10 track 16 sky s the limit one of my favorite beats of the project is right here the piano is so laid back yet it still sounds energetic somehow once again yela switches his style between a dope sung hook and some intense rapping i think i never realized just how dope his voice sounded rapping until this song also the are pretty amazing with him flexing his political knowledge on here 9 10 track 17 disappear damn talk about a sad song somewhat reminded me of last good sleep as far as subject matter goes but that is a pretty weak comparison i have to give props to yela for putting something this personal on his album the instrumental has almost a lullaby tone to it and once the strings kick in i get sad as fuck 9 10 track 18 fiddle me this this was a pretty great way to end the album it would have left you depressed had it ended on disappear but this ends the whole thing on a victory lap sort of feel this is what i would imagine you would hear at a bonfire or a barn party or some shit in the south this made me bob my head something fierce the instrumental is awesome as well with that goddamn fiddle going hard 8 5 10 final verdict i initially thought that this was going to be a big let down after how long yelawolf waited to release it but in reality this went completely the other way than what i expected this album completely blew me away nearly all of the production was amazing and did a great job of mixing country and rap instrumentals together yelawolf himself felt hungry on this release and had lots of dope flows and to go all over this thing obviously i got praise yela for his singing which is the most amazing vocals i think i have ever heard from a rapper the biggest strength of this release is how seamlessly country rap and a little bit of rock have all been merged perfectly in this album there are still some cons to this project the first two songs are decent but the album doesn t really feel like it gets going till track 3 also box chevy v feels a little out of place as well as the eminem verse other than that this shit is golden this is for sure in my top 3 rap projects of the year 9 101,True,,,,,,,,
1400,7MOr1XBgJkZ15noyPOkI1X,waterfalls is complete finished after two years of writing and recording we have gotten to the end point of this journey i conceptualized this project almost exactly two years ago in the basement of my dorm at mizzou waterfalls started off as an homage to the music that made me who i am and to a degree it still is waterfalls as you will find in the title track refers to how i feel when i listen to music whenever an artist such as bob seger or bruce springsteen hit a particular chord or wrote a particularly relatable lyric it created a connection of some sort it

2449,1vvnYpYEMVB4aq9I6tHIEB,yeah for your eyes only for your eyes only for your eyes only for your eyes only hey niggas be dying on the daily it seems my dreams faded for far too long the consequences deadly can t visualize myself as nothing but a criminal control the block serving up rocks and stay subliminal cause young niggas is hardheaded they letting off full of adrenaline ignorant to what death can cause ain t no coming back family dressed in black plus it s hot now the cops outside it s hard to flip a pack and my daughter gotta eat her mama be stressing me like i ain t the one who put them jays on her feet like i ain t out in the field like that i might be low for the moment but i will bounce back despite the charges back to the wall i fight regardless screaming fuck the law my life is lawless that s what you call it ain t got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven this is hell and i don t mean that hyperbolic i try to find employment even if it s wiping toilets but these felonies be making life the hardest resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet or run up on your yard snatch your daughter bike and pawn it that s why i write this sonnet if the pressure get too much for me to take and i break play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it let her know my life is on it for your eyes only for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes only you probably grown now so this song ll hit you if you hearing this unfortunately means that i m no longer with you in the physical not even sure if i believe in god but because you still alive he got me praying that the spiritual is real so i can be a part of you still my pops was killed too so i know how part of you feels maybe you hate me maybe you miss me maybe you spite me life goes in cycles maybe you ll date a nigga just like me i hope not i m tired of dope spots and fiends that smoke rocks i ve seen far too many niggas hopes rot i m writing this because me and the devil had a dance now i see death around the corner pologizing in advance don t know if i ever had a chance at a glance i m a failure addicted to pushing paraphernalia but daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once innocence disappeared by the age of eight years my pops shot up drug related mama addicted so granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging blood was staining the concrete older niggas i loved talked like they was above maintaining a timesheet that s slow money picked up the family business by the age of 13 six years later was handed sentence round the same time is when you came in this world me and your mama thinking what the fuck we naming this girl i told her nina the prettiest name that i could think of for the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen i was 19 took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked ass system set for me and now i fear it s too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that was never set for me i m living fast but not fast enough cause karma keeps on catching up to me and if my past becomes the death of me i hope you understand  for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes only it s several ways i could ve went out too many to count was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout was it the young niggas blasting frustrated cause the cash running out niggas don t know how to act in a drought see baby girl i realized my definition of a real nigga was skewed my views misshaped by new mixtapes that confirmed the shit i learned in the streets was true that real niggas don t speak when they beef with you they just pull up on your street let the heat achoo and if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food i was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops ducking rules hugging blocks that don t love you i pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views much broader than the corner if not it s gon corner you into a box where your son don t even know his pops and the cyclical nature of doing time continues my worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news i got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon and sadly if you re listening now it must mean it s true but maybe there s a chance that it s not and this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels and i can teach you this in person like i m teaching you to tie your own shoes i love you and i hope to god i don t lose you for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes do you understand for your eyes only one day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling what he d been dealing with lately he wasn t telling i tried to pick his brains still he wasn t revealing but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling he said jermaine i knew you since we was children i never asked for nothing when times was hard i never had discussions with you begging you to help me i dealt with the repercussions of my actions i know you tried to steer me way from that shit but that shit was in my blood you know my life i know your momma nigga send my love in case i never get a chance to speak again i won t forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib that s the way i wished my family lived but my granny crib was in the jects i had to interject like nigga what you talking bout fuck is you getting at he said listen i got no time to dive into descriptions but i been having premonitions just call it visions from the other side i got a feeling i won t see tomorrow like the time i m living on is borrowed with that said the only thing i m proud to say i was a father write my story down and if i pass go play it for my daughter when she ready and so i m leaving you this record for your eyes only don t you ever scratch or disrespect it this perspective is a real one another lost ville son i dedicate these words to you and all the other children affected by the mass incarceration in this nation that sent your pops to prison when he needed education sometimes i think that segregation would ve done us better although i know that means that i would never be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl to take back to jonesboro with lil zach and cole world barely one years old now it s 30 years later making sure this story s told girl your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was cold not because he was the first to get some pussy 12 years old not because he used to come through in the caddy on some vogues not because he went from bagging up them grams to serving o s nah your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was hard not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars not because he screamed fuck the law although that was true your daddy was a real nigga cause he loved you for your eyes only226,True,,,,,,,,
